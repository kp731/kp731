- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kp731ðŸ‘€ This is the tutorial for Git , GitHuB and WebStrom 

- Step 1 :- You need to have a github account first. After creating an account, create a new repository . 

- Step 2 : - Now go to git website and download git for windows/mac/linux and install it. Follow the instructions in the website and download and install for your OS version
After installing check git version with  git --version in terminal. 

- Step 3 : - After doing the Above steps, Open the terminal. Create a directory and index.html file.  mkdir folder-name. touch index.html
- Now open with vscode in terminal with code . Or with atom .

- Open the project that you want to put under Git.

- From the main menu, choose VCS | Create Git Repository.

- In the dialog that opens, specify the directory where a new Git repository will be created.

- Git does not support external paths, so if you choose a directory that is outside your project root, make sure that the folder where the repository is going to be created also   contains the project root.

- If you are creating multiple Git repositories inside the project structure, repeat the previous steps for each directory.
